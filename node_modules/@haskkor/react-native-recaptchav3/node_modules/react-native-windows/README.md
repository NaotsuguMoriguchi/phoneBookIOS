[React Native](https://reactnative.dev) is a framework developed by Facebook that enables you to build world-class application experiences on native platforms using a consistent developer experience based on JavaScript and [React](https://reactjs.org/). The focus of React Native is on developer efficiency across all the platforms you care about - learn once, write anywhere.

This repository adds support for the [Windows 10 SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads), which allows you to build apps for [all devices supported by Windows 10](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-started-windows-10) including PCs, tablets, 2-in-1s, Xbox, Mixed reality devices etc.
